# 100 Days Of ML Code Log
I've been working through the courses at DataCamp.com for the past month or two and am getting close to finishing the "Data Scientist Certificate" there... AND I'm working on an ML project at work (which is why I signed up at DataCamp in the first place). For this challenge I intend to do an hour of NOT WORK related ML coding each day.

### Day 1: July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished up the Statistics courses and got the "Data Analyst" certificate on DataCamp. Started the Unsupervised Learning course learning about KMeans and clustering.

**Thoughts** I can see how the statistics are useful for machine learning. I can remember the mean and standard deviation from a course in college, but the later topics are still confusing. I think I need a good book on statistics that makes it all a little more intuitive so I can figure out where to apply the knowledge.

### Day 2: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Unsupervised Learning course and started on Deep Learning. Walked through the code for building a simple (2 layers) neural network. Signed up for DrivenData and Kaggle to find some projects to try applying these concepts to.

**Thoughts** I feel like I've learned a ton from these DataCamp courses, but it's all so fast and I don't know when or how to apply it to real projects. I'm still trying to figure out if the project at work can be solved with machine learning or not (mainly due to lack of relevant data)
