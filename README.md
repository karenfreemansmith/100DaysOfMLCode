# 100 Days Of ML Code Log
I've been working through the courses at DataCamp.com for the past month or two and am getting close to finishing the "Data Scientist Certificate" there... AND I'm working on an ML project at work (which is why I signed up at DataCamp in the first place). For this challenge I intend to do an hour of NOT WORK related ML coding each day.

### Day 4: July 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the DataCamp Deep Learning Network Analysis course and made some more progress on the Interactive Visualization course, should be able to finish it tomorrow and that will wrap up the DataCamp certificate

**Thoughts**
I'm glad to be so close to finished with this online course. I feel like I've learned a lot, but I'm dying to use it on something real. Thinking about possible projects to play around with next.

### Day 3: July 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the second half of DataCamp Deep Learning course (Keras lessons), started working on the Network Analysis course.

**Thoughts** Keras makes it all seem so easy. I'm wondering how fast you use up the computer's resources adding tons of extra layers and nodes to the models. I expect to see this in action when I get back to work (at least that's the rumor I heard before vacation.) I'm really interested in the network analysis though as it seems to relate to the problem we are trying to solve better than either regression or classification. I can't help but notice they are handing us datasets that are not the Pandas DataFrames that we've been using with all the other courses - and I'm wondering what goes into preparing the data for Network Analysis.

### Day 2: July 6, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Unsupervised Learning course and started on Deep Learning. Walked through the code for building a simple (2 layers) neural network. Signed up for DrivenData and Kaggle to find some projects to try applying these concepts to. Ended up doing the first section of "Interactive Visualizations with Bokeh" in the evening.

**Thoughts** I feel like I've learned a ton from these DataCamp courses, but it's all so fast and I don't know when or how to apply it to real projects. I'm still trying to figure out if the project at work can be solved with machine learning or not (mainly due to lack of relevant data). I really like playing with the visualizations, but I can't seem to find the .html files it's supposed to be saving. :(

### Day 1: July 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finally finished up the Statistics courses and got the "Data Analyst" certificate on DataCamp. Started the Unsupervised Learning course learning about KMeans and clustering.

**Thoughts** I can see how the statistics are useful for machine learning. I can remember the mean and standard deviation from a course in college, but the later topics are still confusing. I think I need a good book on statistics that makes it all a little more intuitive so I can figure out where to apply the knowledge.
