# 100 Days Of ML Code Log
I've been working through the courses at DataCamp.com for the past month or two and am getting close to finishing the "Data Scientist Certificate" there... AND I'm working on an ML project at work (which is why I signed up at DataCamp in the first place). For this challenge I intend to do an hour of NOT WORK related ML coding each day.

### Day 8: July 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finding and taking a first look at some more datasets. I'm looking at legos, credit data, school budgets, and characters from asoiaf. (evening) Completed the Lego project at DataCamp.

**Thoughts**
I'm pretty happy with the variety of the data I've got to start with. I've got large and small, and some sets that are intended for different types of ML. I want to be able to experiment a little with using different models and approaches with different types of data. The legos set is most similar to the problems we are looking at on the job. The job itself continues to be frustrating. I want to write code, but I keep getting directed toward setup tasks and other busy work that often seems irrelevant. Was a little disappointed there wasn't more to the Lego project...I hope to do more with my own Lego project. It was, maybe, a good starting point to help think about the datasets I'll be working with on the side.

### Day 7: July 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Research - Looking at the documentation for Bokeh and trying to troubleshoot my charts in Jupyter. Also looking at some machine learning competitions and picking some datasets to work with.

**Thoughts**
Suffering from mid-week frustration at work and trying to fight it off enough to concentrate on learning activities. I don't want to install a server right now. I think this weekend I'll see what it would take to set up a docker container and figure out how to deploy it online somewhere. At some point we need to be able to do this at work as well, so like it or not, I should try to figure it out. Until then I'm going to look at some datasets from machine learning competitions and try to pick one or two to work on. I want to practice what I've been learning on my own projects. Started notebooks for the Titanic data from Kaggle and the DengAI data from DrivenData.

### Day 6: July 10, 2018 (before work)
**Today's Progress**: None...  

**Thoughts**
I was trying to get the interactive graph to work locally, in a Jupyter notebook, the graph shows and the default tools "work", but the stuff I write in code just sits there like it's on a smoke break or something. Found a couple of things in the documentation that make me think it's supposed to be possible in a notebook. I'm really just trying to avoid the whole "set up a server" thing. That sounds like more than I can do in an hour, possibly a weekend task...

I'm also thinking all those notes I was taking for the DataCamp course could really be organized better, the files get too long and there is no good way to search for that one code snippet you are thinking of. I might need to transfer the exercises to a blog instead so I can find stuff easier.

### Day 6: July 9, 2018 (after work)
**Today's Progress**: Finished! Finished the last course for the Data Scientist certificate, finished the interactive graph I was working on this morning...trying to get it to run in a Jupyter Notebook the same as it does in the DataCamp environment, but bedtime...because: work...

**Thoughts**
I'm excited about this interactive graph. I think it will be a killer EDA app for my 'real' projects. I'm trying to decide what comes next still, but whatever it is - this Bokeh stuff is cool and that's how I want to explore the data. Wish it was the weekend so I could have more time to work on it.

### Day 5: July 9, 2018 (before work)
**Today's Progress**: Almost there, one exercise left, but I'm already running late for work so I have to leave it for now.

### Day 4: July 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the DataCamp Deep Learning Network Analysis course and made some more progress on the Interactive Visualization course, should be able to finish it tomorrow and that will wrap up the DataCamp certificate

**Thoughts**
I'm glad to be so close to finished with this online course. I feel like I've learned a lot, but I'm dying to use it on something real. Thinking about possible projects to play around with next.

### Day 3: July 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished the second half of DataCamp Deep Learning course (Keras lessons), started working on the Network Analysis course.

**Thoughts** Keras makes it all seem so easy. I'm wondering how fast you use up the computer's resources adding tons of extra layers and nodes to the models. I expect to see this in action when I get back to work (at least that's the rumor I heard before vacation.) I'm really interested in the network analysis though as it seems to relate to the problem we are trying to solve better than either regression or classification. I can't help but notice they are handing us datasets that are not the Pandas DataFrames that we've been using with all the other courses - and I'm wondering what goes into preparing the data for Network Analysis.

### Day 2: July 6, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Unsupervised Learning course and started on Deep Learning. Walked through the code for building a simple (2 layers) neural network. Signed up for DrivenData and Kaggle to find some projects to try applying these concepts to. Ended up doing the first section of "Interactive Visualizations with Bokeh" in the evening.

**Thoughts** I feel like I've learned a ton from these DataCamp courses, but it's all so fast and I don't know when or how to apply it to real projects. I'm still trying to figure out if the project at work can be solved with machine learning or not (mainly due to lack of relevant data). I really like playing with the visualizations, but I can't seem to find the .html files it's supposed to be saving. :(

### Day 1: July 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Finally finished up the Statistics courses and got the "Data Analyst" certificate on DataCamp. Started the Unsupervised Learning course learning about KMeans and clustering.

**Thoughts** I can see how the statistics are useful for machine learning. I can remember the mean and standard deviation from a course in college, but the later topics are still confusing. I think I need a good book on statistics that makes it all a little more intuitive so I can figure out where to apply the knowledge.
